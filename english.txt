One controversy in the English Wikipedia concerns which national variety of the English language is to be preferred, some candidates being American English and British English.[23] Suggestions range from standardizing upon a single form of English to forking the English Wikipedia project. A style guideline states, "the English Wikipedia has no general preference for a major national variety of the language" and "an article on a topic that has strong ties to a particular English-speaking nation uses the appropriate variety of English for that nation"
